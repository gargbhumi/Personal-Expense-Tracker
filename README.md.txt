Personal Expense Tracker
Project Overview
In today’s fast-paced world, managing personal finances effectively is crucial. This Personal Expense Tracker is a Python-based application that allows users to log daily expenses, categorize spending, and track against a monthly budget. The tracker also provides file-handling functionality to save and load expenses for future reference.
This project demonstrates practical use of Python programming, file handling, and user interface design. It can serve as the foundation for advanced features such as data visualization, ML-based expense forecasting, or AI-powered assistants.
Objectives
Enable users to manage and monitor daily expenses.


Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Travel, Entertainment).


Allow users to set and track monthly budgets.


Save and load expense data for persistence.


Provide a simple, menu-driven interactive interface.
